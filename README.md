# vrp_pilotJob made by Thomas, discord@Thomas.#4655
 Simple pilot job for the framework vrp
 
 This is one of my first vrp releases (making the switch from ESX), hence why vrp usage is very minimal, i only use it in the server script to add money to the bank account and that is it. My plan in the future is to make it require a 'pilot' job to actually get the plane.
 
 Please configure price per passenger in pilotJob_config.lua
