# vrp_pilotJob

Simple pilot job for the framework vrp
 
This is one of my first vrp releases (making the switch from ESX), hence why vrp usage is very minimal, i only use it in the server script to add money to the bank account and that is it. My plan in the future is to make it require a 'pilot' job to actually get the plane and also fix all the spaghetti code.

There are two types of jobs you can be given, one is to fly a private plane, one is a commercial plane (holds more passengers). Completely random which one it gives you.
 
Please configure price per passenger in pilotJob_config.lua
